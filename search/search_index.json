Sometimes these need to be pounted in with a mallet I usually use a 2x4 over the plastic to avoid breaking it Cr8 Start Press the jig into large holes in the frame to align your side drills Drill the holes about 10mm past the dowel hole to allow for bolt clearance Build up Cr8 with 3 sides like this Put lock washer, and nuts on the side of 2 threaded rods Put through the X holes Lie the Box on its side Slide the X-Z Sub over the threaded rods all the way down. This can be a little fiddly but this is the easiest way. Y Axis Start Punch drill and tap all holes M5x25 SHCS in the middle holes of the mounts. Slide the last two threaded rods in the outer holes through the tubes. Ive found it can be helpful to lay the frame on it's back so you are droppin the threaded rod through the holes. Press 1 608 bearing into the front and back of each thrust block. Put the coupler on the motor shaft 10.5mm (ish) from the motor face Slide the shaft collar and one M8 washer onto the leadscrew and then slide the leadscrew through the thrust block. On the inside of the thrust block, slide the thrust bearing stack onto the lead screw and then tighten the coupler onto the lead screw. 4- M3x50 SHCS to bolt through the thrust block to the motor Pull the lead screw away from the motor and press the shaft collar against the thrust block while tightening the set screw. - the goal is to remove the possibility for axial play. Solder the wires for the limit switch and use an M2x12 SHCS to bolt it the thrust block with 2 small holes in the side.

Y Leadnut mount - press M3 nuts into the pockets and screw to the leadnut M3x16 FHCS for all the carriages and lead nut mount Loosen all the screws on one side to make it easier to slide the top in and loosely bolt it in. Window Screw all the window mounts to the Cr8 with 3/4\" wood screws. Pay attention to the hinge mount holes on the top mounts. M3x12 SHCS bolted through the window M3 plastic tap screws or M3 SHCS to bolt the hinges to the top mounts.
